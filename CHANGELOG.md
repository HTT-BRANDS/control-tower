## [Unreleased]

_131 commits since `v2.5.0` (b1137cb, 2026-04-15). Pre-release state on `main`; no release tag yet._

### Added
- **Design-system primitives — py7u Wave 2**: `ds_static_table`, `ds_toolbar`, `ds_modal` (native `<dialog>`), `ds_tabs` + `ds_tab_panel` (full keyboard nav), `ds_form_field` (with `.ds-input` utility).
- **py7u.4 visual parity testing infrastructure** — cross-browser screenshot diffing scaffold.
- **`ds_table` header-slot via `{% call %}` pattern** (hikx) — lets callers inject fully-custom header markup; dmarc tenant-table migrated.
- **Server-rendered HTMX partials** (f8f2) — riverside partials use `HX-Request` content negotiation instead of client-side composition.
- **Bicep architecture fitness function + ratchet** (kj0p) — prevents warning-count regression in IaC.
- **Ready-to-execute scaffolds** for 4 ops tickets (rtwi, 6wyk, 3cs7, gz6i).

### Changed / Refactored
- **File-size policy enforced** (6oj7): three oversized Python files split into cohesion-based packages with preserved public import paths — `graph_client.py` (1208L), `riverside_checks.py` (1432L), `test_sync_api.py` (1230L). All resulting modules < 600 lines; zero behavior change.
- **Table primitive adoption**: `ds_(static_)table` adopted across dashboards, privacy, preflight, and riverside (− 95 lines net).
- **Ghost-class cleanup** (9v9u, cwxu): 20 `border-theme` uses normalized to `border-default`; legacy `wm-*` tokens retired.
- **Stale code removal**: 53 stale `# noqa` directives (RUF100 now enforced); orphaned Bicep modules deleted (app-service-optimized −804L + 2 more, −410L); dead dark-mode generator paths removed (ADR-0005 Phase 4e).
- **`users-table` bespoke** (hbvt) documented with column-parity guard — closed as acceptable exception to the DS migration.

### Fixed
- **CI test bitrot after py7u migration** (6o4g): 5 stale assertions in `tests/integration/test_frontend_e2e.py` were blocking CI on every commit for ~36 hours (40+ consecutive red runs). Assertions updated for the `macros/ds/` facade + Tailwind-v3-standalone-binary architecture. This is a governance incident as much as a test fix; no one was watching CI.
- **All Bicep templates compile** (dv90) — 5 templates with scope/schema issues repaired; zero warnings across the IaC surface (kj0p).
- **Swagger UI markdown rendering** (ncxl) — dedent FastAPI description block.

### Release-gate retroactive governance (April 22, 2026)
- **Retroactive tags added** to restore release provenance: `v2.3.0` → `c492922`, `v2.5.0` → `b1137cb`. Prior to this sweep, `git tag -l 'v2*'` stopped at `v2.2.0` despite `pyproject.toml` declaring `2.5.0` — cryptographic linkage between artifacts and source commits was broken.
- **CHANGELOG back-populated** for the `[2.5.0]` window and the skipped `[2.4.0]` documented below.
- **Release-gate submission dossier** published at `docs/release-gate/submission-v2.5.0.md`.

### Supply-chain hardening (April 23, 2026)
- **SLSA Build Level 3 provenance** on every production image (bd `7mk8`):
  `actions/attest-build-provenance@v2` produces an in-toto SLSA v1 predicate,
  signs it via Sigstore keyless (GitHub OIDC → Fulcio short-lived cert →
  Rekor log), and attaches it as an OCI referrer on the pushed image.
- **SBOM (Syft / SPDX-JSON)** generated and attested on every production
  image (bd `7mk8`). Closes security-audit finding M-3 which had been open
  since the March 2026 audit.
- **Cosign 4-claim verification** (bd `7mk8`) gates the prod deploy job:
  subject digest + predicate type + certificate identity (regex-pinned to
  `deploy-production.yml@refs/heads/(main|release/*)`) + OIDC issuer.
  Verification failure aborts before any Azure API call; the container is
  also now set BY DIGEST (not tag) to eliminate TOCTOU between verify and
  deploy.
- **Arbiter policy file** (`arbiter/policies/verify.yaml`) serves as
  machine-readable source of truth for the 4-claim policy; the workflow
  steps mirror it step-for-step so drift is detectable.
- **All supply-chain actions SHA-pinned** (bd `dq49`): `attest-*`,
  `cosign-installer`, `sbom-action` — each pinned to a full commit SHA
  with a version comment so Dependabot can continue to propose updates.

### CI gates added (April 23, 2026)
- **`env-delta.yaml` schema + literal-rejection validator** (bd `my5r`):
  new `scripts/validate_env_delta.py` (Pydantic v2, StrictBool on
  security-sensitive flags, path-scoped allowlist, 4 exit codes) runs as
  a pre-commit hook AND as a dedicated CI job in `security-scan.yml`,
  feeding into the overall security-summary gate. 24-test suite in
  `tests/unit/test_validate_env_delta.py`. Closes HTT P0 Security
  Requirement #7 (arbiter finding N-4).
- **Scheduled Bicep drift detection** (bd `x692`): new
  `.github/workflows/bicep-drift-detection.yml` runs
  `az deployment group what-if` weekly (Mon 13:00 UTC) against all three
  environments, opens/updates a rolling GitHub issue on drift, and
  optionally pings Teams when the webhook var is configured. The workflow
  itself fails on drift so it becomes visible in branch-protection views.

### Fixed
- **Staging validation suite cold-start flakes** (bd `mvxt` — partial):
  `tests/staging/conftest.py` now runs a progressive warmup loop
  (5 attempts with 10s → 30s → 60s → 90s → 120s timeouts) before the
  first real test, and the shared `requests.Session` gets a urllib3 retry
  adapter for GET/HEAD/OPTIONS on 502/503/504 + connect/read timeouts.
  This is a compensating control — root cause investigation still requires
  Azure Portal / App Insights access and stays tracked in `mvxt`.

## [2.4.0] — SKIPPED

No `2.4.0` was ever published. `pyproject.toml` jumped directly from `2.3.0`
to `2.5.0` at commit `b1137cb` (2026-04-15). This entry exists solely to
preserve SemVer continuity in the historical record.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Multi-Tenant Sync**: BCC/FN/TLL jobs now authenticate with per-tenant OIDC federated credentials
  - Created `github-actions-main` federated credential on BCC, FN, TLL app registrations
  - Added 6 GitHub secrets (`BCC_CLIENT_ID`, `BCC_TENANT_ID`, `FN_CLIENT_ID`, `FN_TENANT_ID`, `TLL_CLIENT_ID`, `TLL_TENANT_ID`)
  - Each sync job uses its own `client-id`/`tenant-id`/`subscription-id` (was: shared HTT client ID causing AADSTS700016)
  - Removed `continue-on-error: true` — failures now surface properly
  - Removed hardcoded tenant IDs from workflow YAML (now in secrets)
- **Production Secrets Removal**: Removed `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` from production App Service
  - OIDC federation confirmed working — zero service principal secrets in staging or production
- **CI/CD Pipeline Overhaul**: 6 workflows diagnosed, 4 fixed, 2 legacy deleted (-967 lines)
  - `deploy-oidc.yml`: Deleted — replaced by dedicated `ci.yml` + fixed `deploy-staging.yml`
  - `deploy.yml`: Deleted — used non-existent `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret (legacy)
  - `deploy-staging.yml`: Fixed trigger from `staging` branch (unused) to `main` branch
  - `deploy-production.yml`: Fixed 4 bugs — `secrets` context in `if`, missing `needs` chain, boolean string default, tag trigger removed
  - `multi-tenant-sync.yml`: Updated `azure/login@v1` to `v2`, added cross-tenant `continue-on-error`
  - `accessibility.yml`: Now tests deployed staging URL instead of trying to start app locally
  - New `ci.yml`: Dedicated lint + test + security scan workflow for every push
- **MEDIUM-3**: Wrapped `credential.get_token()` in `asyncio.to_thread()` in preflight checks (unblocks event loop)
- **MEDIUM-4**: `is_configured()` now checks actual OIDC credential source (WEBSITE_SITE_NAME, AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE) not stale azure_client_id field

### Added
- Azure RBAC: `AcrPush` on staging + prod ACRs for CI service principal
- Azure RBAC: `Contributor` on staging + prod resource groups for CI deploys
- 2 new GitHub Actions federated credentials on HTT app registration (`github-actions-staging`, `github-actions-production`)
- `.acrignore` file to exclude build artifacts from ACR builds
- 2 new unit tests for OIDC `is_configured()` scenarios
- **Externalized tenant configuration** (LOW-1 remediation): `config/tenants.yaml` (gitignored) replaces hardcoded IDs
  - `config/tenants.yaml.example` committed as template with placeholder UUIDs
  - `app/core/tenants_config.py` loads from YAML with automatic fallback to example file
  - Shell scripts (`setup-federated-creds.sh`, `verify-federated-creds.sh`) read from YAML via shared `_tenant_lookup.sh`
  - Eliminates DRY violation (IDs were duplicated in Python + 2 shell scripts)

### Changed
- Test count: 2,935 to 2,937 (+2)
- GitHub workflows: 6 to 5 (2 deleted + 1 created)
- GitHub secrets: 6 to 12 (+6 per-tenant secrets for multi-tenant sync)

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **OIDC Workload Identity Federation**: Zero-secret tenant authentication via App Service Managed Identity
  - `app/core/oidc_credential.py`: `OIDCCredentialProvider` with 3-tier credential resolution (App Service → Workload Identity → Dev fallback)
  - `scripts/setup-federated-creds.sh`: One-time Azure CLI script to configure federated credentials on all 5 app registrations
  - `scripts/verify-federated-creds.sh`: Read-only verification of federated credential configuration across all tenants
  - `scripts/seed_riverside_tenants.py`: Seeds all 5 real Riverside tenants into the DB with `use_oidc=True` and no secrets
  - `alembic/versions/007_add_oidc_federation.py`: Idempotent migration adding `use_oidc` boolean column to `tenants` table
  - `docs/OIDC_TENANT_AUTH.md`: Complete setup, operational, and troubleshooting guide for OIDC tenant auth
  - `USE_OIDC_FEDERATION`, `AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`, and `OIDC_ALLOW_DEV_FALLBACK` config fields on `Settings`
  - 47 new tests (41 unit + 6 config); `tests/unit/test_oidc_credential.py`, `tests/smoke/test_oidc_connectivity.py` — total suite: 2,935 passed

### Changed
- `app/api/services/azure_client.py`: `get_credential()` dispatches to OIDC path when `USE_OIDC_FEDERATION=true`; composite cache key `tenant_id:client_id` prevents stale credentials after app registration rotation; `clear_cache()` uses prefix matching
- `app/api/services/graph_client.py`: `_get_credential()` routes through `azure_client_manager` singleton — `clear_cache()` now correctly invalidates Graph credentials
- `app/preflight/azure_checks.py`: Auth check accepts OIDC mode; `_sanitize_error()` result now used; `logger.exception` replaced with structured `logger.error` in all 8 auth catch blocks
- `app/core/tenants_config.py`: `key_vault_secret_name` now optional (`None`); `oidc_enabled=True` for all 5 tenants; `get_app_id_for_tenant()` helper added; `validate_tenant_config()` skips secret-name check when OIDC enabled
- `app/models/tenant.py`: Added `use_oidc: bool` column (default `False`)
- `app/core/config.py`: Added `use_oidc_federation`, `azure_managed_identity_client_id`, `oidc_allow_dev_fallback` fields; `is_configured` property is OIDC-aware
- `.env.example`: Added OIDC section with `OIDC_ALLOW_DEV_FALLBACK=true`; fixed stale `RIVERSIDE_*_APP_ID` values
- Test suite: 2,888 → 2,935 (+47 tests)

### Security
- Removed client secret requirement for all 5 Riverside tenant API calls when OIDC mode is enabled
- Added `OIDC_ALLOW_DEV_FALLBACK` production kill switch — raises `RuntimeError` if neither App Service nor Workload Identity environment detected (prevents silent fallback to unscoped `DefaultAzureCredential`)
- Fixed dead `_sanitize_error()` code — auth errors now correctly sanitized before including in `CheckResult.details`
- Composite `tenant_id:client_id` cache key prevents stale credential serving after app registration rotation
- `GraphClient` now shares credential cache with `AzureClientManager` singleton — emergency `clear_cache()` is effective for both ARM and Graph API paths

### Pending (Azure-Side Setup Required)
- Configure federated credentials on app registrations: `./scripts/setup-federated-creds.sh`
- Enable OIDC mode: `USE_OIDC_FEDERATION=true` on App Service
- Seed real tenant records: `uv run python scripts/seed_riverside_tenants.py`
